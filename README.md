# COVID TRACKER
Simple COVID-19 tracker written in python.

The data fetching process is different from country to country.
Generally the data are obtained through the CSV files posted daily on github by John Hopkins University
The italian data are fetched by the Italian department of health by web scraping

When the world situation is selected, all the data, included the italian, come from the JHU repo.

In this way, the world and all the other countries' data are updated daily, while the italian statistics are updated twice a day (11AM and 5PM UTC).
